Description: Streamlines the interaction with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) <https://www.rcsb.org/>. This interface offers an intuitive and 
            powerful tool for searching and retrieving a diverse range of data types from the PDB. It includes advanced functionalities like 
            BLAST and sequence motif queries. Built upon the existing XML-based API of the PDB, it simplifies the creation of custom requests, 
            thereby enhancing usability and flexibility for researchers.
