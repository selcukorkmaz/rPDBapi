Description: Streamlines the interaction with the 'RCSB' Protein Data Bank ('PDB') <https://www.rcsb.org/>. This interface offers an intuitive and 
            powerful tool for searching and retrieving a diverse range of data types from the 'PDB'. It includes advanced functionalities like 
            'BLAST' and sequence motif queries. Built upon the existing XML-based 'API' of the 'PDB', it simplifies the creation of custom requests, 
            thereby enhancing usability and flexibility for researchers.
